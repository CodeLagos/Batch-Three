#This programme is named 'financial report manager'. It's fucntion is to collect daily financial report from the user and analyse such input and be able to deduce if the financial report for the day is balanced.It computes the data inputted by the user and save a copy of the financial report on the computer for the user's future reference. The saved data might as well be accessible using this programme or by digging directly into the computerâ€™s directory.
#THIS PROJECT WAS CARRIED OUT SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE USE OF THE FOLLOWING: function,while loop,for loop,input,conditionals,list,dictionary,files,exception & string formatting

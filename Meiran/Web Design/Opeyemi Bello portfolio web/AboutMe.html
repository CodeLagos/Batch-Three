<h2>About Me</h2>
<hr>
<p><img src="image/photo.jpg"/> My name is <strong><em>Opeyemi Bello</em></strong>. I started school when I was three years old. I went to kindergarten through nursery at Saint Jude’s Children’s School and while I was there, I won an award for perfect attendance. I also won an award for honour roll throughout the academic sessions. Then I attended the community primary school, and there I also won a couple of awards: one for perfect attendance and two for being named Student of the Year - one in primary four and the other in primary six. I was part of team <span id="red">red</span> even though I didn't get to do much of sports. In grammar school I was a member of the cultural club and was part of the <span id="green">green</span> house sports team. I have a Media Arts degree from the nation’s premier university. </p>
<p> I was born on a warm, sunny day in November in Surulere, Lagos. Presently, I live in the quiet Ajasa-Command area of Lagos, and I attend coding classes at the CodeLagos Out-of-School Batch-3 Program situated within the buildings of the Meiran Public Library. I love reading, editing videos and watching live theatre productions and documentary movies.  My favourite food is African salad and favourite colour is <span id="blue">blue</span> because it - I assume - is the warmest colour. I love music; jazz, soul, funk and everything in-between. You can call me a polyglot. I have a huge interest in languages. I speak the English and Yorùbá language, have an intermediate knowledge of the German language and basic understanding of Spanish and Italia. I'm a jack of few multimedia trades but I want to be a master of web development and hopefully become a Full Stack JavaScript developer in no time.</p>
<p> Lastly, and as I said in the previous paragraph, I was born here in Lagos and I've lived here most of my young life. I would like to see more of Nigeria and Africa but I presently don't have the resources to leave Lagos to go anywhere. This is why I decided to take advantage of the opportunity provided by the Lagos State Government’s CodeLagos Out-of-School Program in order to get new skills that can equip one for the opportunities in a world moving into the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Within the six weeks of CodeLagos, I have learnt how to use HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and Wordpress to create wholesome front-end web designs. As the program comes to an end, I am really grateful to the Lagos State Government, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Education, <a class="link"href="twitter.com/felabankolemoh" target=_blank>Fela Bank-Olemoh</a> for opening this vista of auspicious opportunities for the people of Lagos. What's next with my new found skills - which in addition to my knowledge of Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects - is to get an internship in order to advance my understanding of web development and to ultimately learn JavaScript.</p>
<p>Yes I said lastly before and now in conclusion, I hope you have enjoyed reading my life story as much as I have enjoyed writing it for you albeit it’s for my final coding class project. While I continue to follow this path of front-end web development, I say <em>arriverdeci</em>. See you someday! </p>
